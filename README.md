# K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN)
- K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) is one of the simplest Machine Learning algorithms based on Supervised Learning technique
- KNN is a type of supervised learning algorithm used for both regression and classification, but mostly it is used for the Classification problems.
- KNN algorithm assumes the similarity between the new case/data and available cases and put the new case into the category that is most similar to the available categories.
