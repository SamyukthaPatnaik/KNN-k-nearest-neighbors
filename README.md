# K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN)
- K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) is one of the simplest Machine Learning algorithms based on **Supervised Learning technique**
- KNN is a type of supervised learning algorithm used for both **regression and classification**, but mostly it is used for the Classification problems.
- KNN algorithm assumes the similarity between the new case/data and available cases and put the new case into the category that is **most similar** to the available categories.

## The KNN Algorithm
- Load the data
- Initialize **K** to your chosen number of neighbors
- Calculate the **Euclidean distance** of K number of neighbors

The Euclidean distance is the distance between two points, which we have already studied in geometry. It can be calculated as:
